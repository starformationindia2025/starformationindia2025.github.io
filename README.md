## Beautiful Math with MathJax (optional)

If you need to include mathematical notation in the website, you can use MathJax. To do this, add the following code to the `<head>` of the HTML files where math is required:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" async 
    src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js?config=default"> 
</script>
